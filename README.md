# About this project

This was a group project. We were asked to deliver an educational platform for a jiu jitsu school. 
Members each got their own logins and were able to view video's on certain jiu jitsu moves up to their grade. 
Both teachers and members are able to comment on the video's. 

Logins and CRUD for educational material would be provided later through a JAVA application. 

# Logins

One teacher and one member login is provided. 

Usernames: "TeacherAccount" and "MemberAccount"

Password is "P@ssword1" for both accounts. 

The code and project is in Dutch.
